A heavy use of CSS animations and JavaScript animation frames helped to create a dynamic single page site that showcased the best parts of the SEAT Leon CUPRA.

> SEAT were launching their all-new Leon Cupra; an authentic track racer optimised for everyday use. Being as thrilling to drive on the streets as it is on the track, it allowed you to ‘intensify the everyday’. We harnessed this idea and built a mobile site with two sides. From the homepage, users could choose ‘track’ or ‘road’ by swiping right or left, and navigate their way through the site, creating the illusion of two adjacent, concurrent sites.
