Mobile site, SMS and ticket scanning for Virgin Media customers at V&nbsp;Festival.

> We’ve worked with Virgin Media for the past three years to put mobile at the heart of their super special customer area at V&nbsp;Festival. Everyone invited receives an SMS with a link to a mobile site containing their unique barcode ticket and useful information about the area and the festival itself.  
> It’s proven to be rather effective in both getting people to access the area and the mobile site, although the free Wi-Fi, drinks and posh toilets probably helped too.
