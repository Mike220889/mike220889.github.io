A highly interactive mobile site that used pinch & zoom touch events to trigger page transitions. CSS3 3D transforms helped create the illusion of traveling in towards the site's z-axis.

> The new Leon ST is super spacious. So we concepted, designed and developed an interactive mobile site based on the creative idea ‘More Space. More Life.’ It made use of the pinch and zoom functionality alongside parallax scrolling and took users on a journey through space to showcase the ST’s incredible boot space potential.
